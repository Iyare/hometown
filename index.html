                    <h2>About</h2>
                    <p>Benin City is the capital of Edo State in southern Nigeria. It is a city approximately 25 miles
                        north of the Benin River. It is situated 200 miles by road east of Lagos. Benin City is the
                        centre of Nigeria's rubber industry, but processing palm nuts for oil is still an important
                        traditional industry. The city is also the home of the University of Benin. The people of Benin
                        City are known for their bronze casting, wood carving and other crafts. The Oba of Benin is the
                        traditional ruler of the Edo people and all Edos respect the Oba. The Oba of Benin's Palace is a
                        UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Benin Bronzes are a group of plaques and sculptures that
                        decorated the Royal Palace of Benin City. The Benin Bronzes are now displayed in various museums
                        around the world. The Benin Bronzes are a reminder of the rich history and culture of the Edo
                        people.</p>
